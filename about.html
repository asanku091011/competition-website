    <h2>About the Competition</h2>
    <p>
      MSK MedQuest is an exciting and educational medical science competition designed for young innovators
      with a passion for understanding the human body. Participants will have the opportunity to either create
      a hands-on project or take part in a rigorous medical knowledge test, showcasing their
      curiosity, creativity, and analytical thinking. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This year’s challenge invites competitors to dive deep
      into the fascinating worlds of the digestive and cardiovascular systems, exploring how our bodies process
      nutrients, circulate blood, and maintain vital functions that sustain life.
      Through this experience, students will strengthen their understanding of anatomy and physiology while
      applying scientific reasoning to real-world medical concepts.
      Whether designing an innovative health-related project or demonstrating mastery through testing,
      participants will gain valuable insight into the inner workings of the human body and the interconnected
      systems that make it function. MSK MedQuest encourages every student to think like a future healthcare
      leader: curious, compassionate, and committed to discovery.
